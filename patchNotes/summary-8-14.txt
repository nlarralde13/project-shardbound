Here’s a clean prompt you can drop into a new chat to continue from exactly where you are now:

I’m building a browser-based MMO engine in vanilla JS + ES modules with PIXI.js.
The **overworld** is a **150×150 tile grid**, each tile = **1 km²**. I have **5 interconnected overworld maps** that make up the core world. Everything is procedural within **predefined biome parameters**.

**New design direction:**

* Each overworld tile has **metadata** including:

  * `biome` (ocean, forest, desert, tundra, grassland, etc.)
  * `sliceOptions` object defining procedural parameters for its zoomed-in view:

    ```json
    {
      "can_spawn_fish": true,
      "fish_density": 0.1,
      "mob_density": 0.1,
      "resources": ["oil", "kelp", "seawater"],
      "dungeon_chance": 0.01
    }
    ```
* Clicking an overworld tile **enters “Slice View”**: a **static 10×10 grid of rooms** (representing the 1 km² broken into sub-rooms).
* Slice generation rules:

  * Uses the parent tile’s biome & sliceOptions to procedurally populate rooms.
  * Player spawns in the room corresponding to their entry direction.
  * Outer rooms have exits leading back to the overworld (adjacent tiles).
* **Performance approach**:

  * Overworld schema loads tile-by-tile into a **web-based editor UI** for editing biome & sliceOptions.
  * Save to local file for now; later, move to server storage so clients don’t do heavy work.
  * All slice generation should be deterministic from tile metadata + seed (so no persistent storage needed for unmodified slices).

**Current tech state:**

* `mapConfig.js` defines shard/tile sizes and zoom levels.
* `rdmShardGen.js` generates overworlds procedurally.
* `generateSlice.js` can build a procedural mini-map from seed + coordinates.
* `generateRoom.js` builds individual room data.
* `renderShard.js` handles isometric rendering with hover/selection outlines.
* `playerState.js` tracks player position, token, and movement.
* `viewportState.js` manages current view state (`shard`/`slice`/`room`).
* `shardLoader.js` handles load/save/regenerate of shard JSON.
* `camera.js` controls zoom and scroll.
* The editor UI exists but needs integration for editing this schema on a per-tile basis.

**Goal for next steps:**

1. Integrate overworld schema into the editor so each tile’s `biome` and `sliceOptions` can be edited visually.
2. On click:

   * If in play mode: load slice via `generateSlice.js` using tile metadata.
   * If in dev mode: open editor panel for that tile.
3. Make sure overworld JSON structure supports storing slice generation parameters.
4. Keep rendering and movement performant for both overworld and slice views.
5. Plan for eventual server-side hosting & editing.

Do you want me to also include a **diagram** in that new chat showing the overworld → slice → room navigation flow? That would make the system design clearer.
